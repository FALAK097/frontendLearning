# Closures

1. Closures in JavaScript refer to the ability of a nested function to access variables from its containing (parent) function's scope, even after the parent function has completed execution.

2. This includes access to both the local variables within the parent function and any variables from the global scope.

3. Closures provide a way to create and maintain private variables in JavaScript, encapsulating them within the scope of a function.

## IIFE (Immediately Invoked Funtional Expressions)

1. IIFE are the functions that runs as soon as it is defined.

2. They are used to create closueres and access private variables

3. They avoid polluting the global namespaces. Execeute an async await, etc.s
