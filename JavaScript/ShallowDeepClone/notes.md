# Shallow Copy

> 1. A shallow copy creates a new object or array, but it does not create new copies of nested objects or arrays within the original object or array.
> 2. Instead, it copies references to the nested objects or arrays.
> 3. As a result, changes made to the nested objects or arrays in the copied structure will affect the original structure, and vice versa.

## Deep Copy

> 1. A deep copy creates a completely independent copy of an object or array, including all nested objects or arrays.
> 2. Changes made to the nested structures in the copied object or array do not affect the original structure, and vice versa.
